Here is the purpose of making this project :
- To fulfill the requirements of the second small assignment for the course IF2211 Algorithm Strategy.
- To implement Divide And Conquer Algorithm in building a Bezier curve.
- To compare between Divide And Conquer to Brute Force Algorithm in building a Bezier curve.

## Abstraction

This project compares Divide and Conquer algorithm with the Brute Force algorithm in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy in building a Bezier Curve.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to perform several installations, including:
- `Python3` : Python3 is programming language that used to implement the bot and handle all the logic in this game

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the following python library installed


## File Structures Overview
This repository contains main folder structure such as _doc_, _public_, and _src_.
- `doc`: This folder contains documents that provide accountability for the development of this project, as part of a major assignment. In other words, the "doc" folder will contain reports created for this project.
- `public`: This folder used to store any public data and any other data and assets
- `src`: This folder contains the primary codebase for building this project, consistings of Bot folder for logic handler and Game Engine folder
